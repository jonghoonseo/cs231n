visual data = "the dark matter of the internet"
 - existence but hard to recognize

 In humans, we have almost 50% of the neurons in our cortex involved in visual processing it is the biggest sensory system.

 Hubel & Wiesel, 1959
 - using electrophysiology
 - question?: what was the visual processing mechanism like in primates(영장류), in mammals(포유류)
 - used cat brain
 - what they did
 	- stick some electrodes in the back of the cat brain which is where the primary visual cortex area is
 	- and then look at what stimuli makes the neurons in the back in the primary visual cortex of cat brain respond excitedly
 - learned
 	- there are many types of cells in the, in the primary visual cortex part of the cat brain
	- one of the most important cell is the simpel cells they respond to oriented edges when they move in certain directions
	- visual processing starts with simple structure of the visual world - oriented edges - and as information moves along the visual processing pathway. The brain builds up the complexity of the visual information until it can recognize the complex visual world.

Object Recognition <-- segmentation

Why CNN is suddenly populated in 2000's?
1. Computation
2. Data
